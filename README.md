# IFNAS


The code is coming

IF-NAS explores the search algorithm upon a complicated search space with long-distance connections, and show that existing weight-sharing search algorithms fail due to the existence of interleaved connections. IF-NAS designs a periodic sampling strategy to construct sub-networks during the search procedure, avoiding the interleaved connections to emerge in any of them. In addition, we propose a more complicated search space, which is more potential and IF-NAS outperforms both random sampling and previous weight-sharing search algorithms by significant margins in this space. IF-NAS can also be well generalized to the micro cell-based spaces. This study emphasizes the importance of macro structure and we look forward to further efforts along this direction.
